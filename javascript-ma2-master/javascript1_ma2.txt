//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?
		Function literal is and are the expressions that makes up a complete function. 
		A function parameter and the statement contained in a function’s body are function 
		literal including the reserved keyword “function”. If a function has a name, it is also 
		a  function literal. This simply means literals forms function object.


2. What is the constructor?
		A constructor is use with the keyword “New” to create objects of the same type with 
		same properties but different in property’s value.

3. What does the return statement do?
		A return statement can be use to express the outcome of statements / code in a
		function before itself but and will stop any other statement after itself in the same 
		function from being executed. This simply means, it is used to express the value 
		of parameters in a function but stopping other codes in the same function from being
		executed after its invocation. 

4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();

		“Inside my function” will be logged to the console because the expression / code ‘return’ 
		will stop other code / statement beneath it from being executed.

5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.
		If allowed, in my own words, scope in javascript is determined by the position 
		where a variable is declared. When a variable is declared first before any other 
		expression or statement; it is said to be Global Scope. In other case, a variable
		declared After a function or other statement, is called a Function or local scope. 
		This forms both type of scope available: Global and Local / Function scope.
